# somehow not available on beaglebone black's Debian, huh

# for dist upgrades to new releases:
#apt-get install -y debian-keyring
# actually this is wrong, only debian-archive-keyring seems used and
# that one is installed anyway? It's Priority: important.

# Need *some* mail software, to at least be able to read messages from

apt-get install -y bsd-mailx
