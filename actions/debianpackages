apt-get install -y net-tools || true

apt-get install -y ltrace || true
# somehow not available on beaglebone black's Debian, huh

# for dist upgrades to new releases:
#apt-get install debian-keyring
# actually this is wrong, only debian-archive-keyring seems used and
# that one is installed anyway? It's Priority: important.

# Need *some* mail software, to at least be able to read messages from

# exim4-daemon-light
apt-get install -y bsd-mailx

# Stuff that's missing in debootstrap images:

apt-get install -y locales man

# Stuff needed in general, excluding Perl packages (for those, see

# These are rather optional:

# System installation:

apt-get install -y gparted
