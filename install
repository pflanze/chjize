Run:
    
    PATH=/opt/chj/chjize/bin:$PATH
    chjize -h

for the list of available targets (the same as shown
[below](#current-list-of-targets)). To e.g. only install my software
into `/opt/chj` (and dependences, see `targets.mk` or the
[graph](#graph-of-target-dependencies) below), run:

    chjize chj

Unlike Ansible, this caches which actions were already done, and is
thus more efficient when asking the same target repeatedly (even
across runs). If an action for some reason really should be re-run,
unlink the file with the same name as the target.

May work with parallel builds (`-j2` etc.), since we're now using
wrappers around `apt-get` and `apt` (in [bin/](bin/)) that use waiting
locks.
